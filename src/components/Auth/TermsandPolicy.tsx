            <h3 className="font-bold">1. Description of Service</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              Parcel is a logistics service currently operating exclusively
              within Lokoja, Kogi State, Nigeria. Our web application,
              accessible at theparcel.com.ng or www.theparcel.com.ng, allows
              users to transport items ("parcels") from one location to another
              within Lokoja. The service is designed for use on desktops, mobile
              devices, and tablets.
            </p>
            <br />

            <p>
              Our target users include businesses, individuals, and students who
              wish to send items. An ideal parcel size and weight for transport
              by one person on a bike is generally up to 15 kg (approximately 33
              lbs) and dimensions not exceeding 50cm x 40cm x 30cm (length x
              width x height). If the weight or size of your parcel exceeds
              these specifications, a 50% refund will be issued for the service.
            </p>
            <br />

            <p>
              When sending a parcel, we will collect the name, email, and phone
              number of the receiver, as well as the name and description of the
              parcel from you. We do not require users to upload any content to
              the platform at this time.
            </p>
            <br />
